**The To-Do List App — Developers Club Recruitment Project**

Hi! I’m Anjana Chandru (CS24B2014), and this is my project for the Developers Club recruitment. I’m really passionate about making websites and projects and also use producitvity planners myself. So, I wanted to build something easy-to-use, helpful, and visually pleasing that I’d love to use myself.

**Introduction**

This app features a minimalistic white-and-blue design, with easy navigation and easy-to-use features and pages like Dashboard, Calendar, Track, Reports, Help & Support, and Settings — all working together seamlessly. On opening the app, you’re greeted by a _**login page**_ where you can enter:

Username: jana

After Logging in, we enter the **_Dashboard_**, which is the main page, where we can firstly see **_today's tasks_,** followed by an **_hourly day view_**. Following, are panels to see the day after and the entire week's tasks to plan ahead. All of this is _**functional,**_ and if we add tasks, we can see it appear, on the hour view, and task lists of today/tomorrow/ nextweek. In the third panel, we have a _**daily task progress pie chart**_ which updates as tasks are completed, We have a _**pomodoro focus timer**_ to boost concentration and a friends tab, to _**add collaborators**_ on tasks, or have team events.

The below screenshots show the working of the dashboard:

We have a **_sidebar_**, with options to open the Calender page, Track page, Reports page, Help & Support page and Settings page. It's a sidebar that has the option to _collapse_, for better viewing options. 

**_Track_** page, we can view general goals under which tasks can be grouped, it shows the number of tasks under a goal and the progress bar of that goal. It helps measure our goals and helps achieve them faster. We have a habit tracker that records our activity and maintains streak. We can add/delete habits. We can also view pending overdue tasks, and a happiness meter that measures daily habit completions and activity on the website,

_**Help & Support**_ page is a simple FAQ page for now. It answers basic questions. I kept it clean and direct.

_**Setting**_ page, lets you see and update profile. It also reminds you with a motivational quote, and has a header bar like the other pages.

**_Calendar_** page is simple calendar view where you can scroll through months, to see events and taks. When tasks are added, they appear as small labels on their respective dates, so it helps see and plan how busy each day is.

This is it for now, but there are so many feautures I wanted to build if I had more time. Like an Event planner, Functional Collaborative Tasks, Assignment trackers, Deadline Reminders, Push Notifications, Dark mode, Motivational quotes and message popups, Newsletters in Email that record your productivity and mood throught the year, and more animations to make it more exciting. 

But, I focused on building the main workflow: a neat dashboard, a working Pomodoro timer, functional task lists that sync with the timeline and calendar, to make a simple but effective to-do-list website.

**How I made it**

I drew rough wireframes on paper to see how each page would look and interact with every other page. I wanted a simple but helpful interface with clear sections and easy navigation. After the design, I began coding, I tried creating everything in github, with HTML, CSS, and JS. 

I loved adding the feautures, and little extra widgets, to make the experience kinda more fun and It was really fulfillng to see it come together. The features I added: Pomodoro Timer, Hourly day view, Calender that's dynamic and updates, Daily Productivity Measuring Graphs and Charts, etc. 

I wanted to add more features, like Collaborative Tasks, Assignment trackers, Deadline Reminders, Pomodoro timer with sound options of sea/storm/forest, because certain white noises boost productivity. The tight deadline and debugging slowed my process down tho. 

But, the entire process altogether was very fulfilling. Everytime I added something, like the progress chart updating live or the timer — it was really fun, committing the change, then waiting to see it load, and then, watching it appear, it made the effort very very worthwhile.

I’ve learned a lot throughout this process, and I hope this shows my enthusiasm and capability, and I’m very excited (and honestly a little nervous) to share it with the Developers Club!

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!
