**The To-Do List App — Developers Club Recruitment Project** <\br>
Hi! I’m Anjana Chandru (CS24B2014), and this is my project for the Developers Club recruitment. I’m really passionate about making websites and projects and also use producitvity planners myself. So, I wanted to build something easy-to-use, helpful, and visually pleasing that I’d love to use myself.

**Introduction**
This app is a minimalistic, white-and-blue themed to-do list. It features a dashboard, calendar, task tracker, reports, and support pages — all connected for a seamless experience.

**How I made it**
I drew rough wireframes on paper to see how each page would look and interact with every other page. I wanted a simple but helpful interface with clear sections and easy navigation. After the design, I began coding, I tried creating everything in github, with HTML, CSS, and JS. 

I loved adding the feautures, and little extra widgets, to make the experience kinda more fun and It was really fulfillng to see it come together. The features I added: Pomodoro Timer, Hourly day view, Calender that's dynamic and updates, Daily Productivity Measuring Graphs and Charts, etc. 

I wanted to add more features, like Collaborative Tasks, Assignment trackers, Deadline Reminders, Pomodoro timer with sound options of sea/storm/forest, because certain white noises boost productivity. The tight deadline and debugging slowed my process down tho. 

But, the entire process altogether was very fulfilling. Everytime I added something, like the progress chart updating live or the timer — it was really fun, committing the change, then waiting to see it load, and then, watching it appear, it made the effort very very worthwhile.

I’ve learned a lot throughout this process, and I hope this shows my enthusiasm and capability, and I’m very excited (and honestly a little nervous) to share it with the Developers Club!

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!
